# Search Engine EVA Agent

An evidence-driven evaluation and diagnosis agent for e-commerce search ranking.
The project uses Amazon Shopping Queries ESCI to compare BM25, vector retrieval,
hybrid ranking, and Cross-Encoder reranking. Every conclusion must be traceable
to a dataset version, run configuration, metric, and ranked product list.
The intended product loop is approval-gated optimization: the Agent finds bad
cases, proposes bounded strategy changes, runs the Harness, compares evidence,
and shows a panel where a human accepts or rejects the strategy update.

## Project status

**Full-catalog baseline, Stage 2 Harness, an optional LLM stage-aware Agent
Runtime loop, and the first fixed Agent Eval suite: in progress.** The Owner
has prioritized an experience milestone: all 1,814,924 official ESCI products
must first be searchable on the existing portfolio page, while the optimized
lane remains closed. This product-search track uses a persistent SQLite FTS5
index and does not unlock or weaken the relevance-evaluation test boundary.

The Stage 1 technical data
gate is complete, while its owner learning check remains pending. The repository
now includes hand-verified nDCG, MRR and Success metrics, the versioned
`esci-primary-v1` relevance policy, a shared label-blind Ranker Harness, and
deterministic random, keyword-overlap and title-BM25 comparators. Routine Stage
2 now also has a strict `compare_runs` path: it verifies both Runs against the
trusted Stage 1 manifest, recomputes their metrics, and emits aggregate plus
per-Query ranking differences. Execution remains smoke-only: the 500-Query dev
profile is code-locked until the Owner data-boundary checkpoint is recorded, and
the 8,956-Query frozen test remains unavailable to tuning runs.

A smoke-only Stage 3/4 Runtime exposes strictly typed evaluation tools, branches
on observations, enforces budgets and stores an offline-replayable Trace. The
original trusted-Run comparison task and the stage-aware retrieval task now use
the same Runtime/Trace/Replay boundary. The exact-boost optimizer remains a
separate controller and is not represented as a Runtime Trace yet.
The retrieval task can run either the deterministic control or an optional
OpenAI/Volcengine Agent Plan provider that chooses one server-generated option
ID per Observation in a hard-deadline child process. Both providers use fixed
first-party endpoints and isolated Key namespaces; see
[ADR-010](docs/adr/010-volcengine-agent-plan-provider.md). The model never
constructs tool arguments or owns Harness, approval or activation decisions.

Stage 5 now has a fixed 12-task Agent Evaluation Harness with an independent
static Oracle. It exercises observation-driven branching, one-retry recovery,
safe failure, unauthorized-tool containment, step budgets, clean Replay and
tamper rejection. Results are attributed separately to eight production-Planner
tasks and four finite Harness-stimulus containment tasks; a combined 12/12 is
not presented as twelve production-Planner decisions. This evaluates Agent
behavior, not search relevance. A separate source-bounded Query constructor
requires a clean revision and independently pins the committed 20-Query smoke
view before producing 59 development cases (20 originals and 39 unjudged
synthetic cases). It cannot read the locked 500-Query dev or frozen test
profiles, and its mixed output is ineligible for formal nDCG/MRR evaluation.

The first source-bounded Bad Case executor now runs exactly those 59 cases
against the immutable full-catalog SQLite BM25 baseline. It reports only
observable zero-result, spelling-sensitive, token-order-sensitive and
ranking-change-needs-judgment candidates; it reads no relevance labels and
computes no quality metric. Completed evidence binds the Query set, executor
revision, index identity/config, Top 10 and all 59 calls, while a separate
execution receipt records dynamic timing. It cannot diagnose multi-stage drop,
approve or activate a strategy. Execution now runs in a fixed POSIX child
process group behind a 125-second monotonic deadline; a separate immutable
supervisor receipt proves which completed execution crossed that boundary.

The current 40-candidate population can now be rebuilt as a deterministic Human
Diagnostic Oracle batch: 30 synthetic intent judgments are collected before 40
behavior judgments, with append-only/CAS state and server-verified Top-3 views.
This helps distinguish useful diagnostic patterns from false positives. It is
still not a product-relevance label set or a formal quality Oracle, so it cannot
authorize a strategy or unlock the quality lane by itself.

A separate diagnostic router turns that immutable evidence into one allowlisted
experiment plan. The first candidate keeps strict AND as the primary search,
uses drop-one-token routes only after a zero result, protects numeric/model/
product-ID-like tokens and fuses fallback ranks with RRF. The plan explicitly
separates full-catalog behavior recovery from labelled quality evidence and
keeps quality conclusions, strategy writes and activation locked. It is an
executable experiment specification, not proof that the candidate is better.

A local-only stage-aware Agent task now makes recall, RRF fusion and coarse
ranking explicit. On the fixed 20-Query fully judged pool it diagnoses the
baseline, then can use either a deterministic control or an LLM Planner to run
uniform, conservative and aggressive
multi-field RRF candidates under two retrieval-only tool capabilities. Uniform
fails seven gates, conservative passes all 12, and the bounded aggressive probe
fails two in the recorded deterministic control. The complete action/observation
path is replay-validated and
returned to the workbench as a read-only timeline. This result is eligible for
Owner review only: the endpoint does not approve a strategy, modify the active
catalog, affect `/catalog/search` or deploy anything.

The optimizer diagnoses title-ranking failure signals, selects a bounded set of
exact-boost candidates, runs each against the current active baseline, and
applies seven aggregate and Query-regression gates before choosing a proposal.
The first round starts from title BM25; after approval, the next optimizer round
uses the approved config and skips duplicates. It writes approve/reject
decisions plus approved optimizer-baseline configs under ignored `runs/`
locally or a private production artifact root. The public workbench can request
and inspect proposals. A separate Owner page uses Basic authentication plus
same-origin, short-lived single-use release tokens for approve/reject/rollback.
Approval still does not imply activation: the full-field index, exact
config/revision and serving sentinel must pass before an atomic pointer changes
the explicit active search lane. The immutable baseline `/catalog/search` lane
never changes. This proves a bounded control/evidence path, not LLM decision
quality or production search quality.

The optional OpenSearch 3.8.0 adapter, mapping, and Apple Silicon-compatible
Compose profile are implemented. Live container verification remains pending
because Docker is not installed on the current development host. This is an
explicit pending integration check, not an implicit fallback or a claimed pass.

## Quick start

Prerequisites: Python 3.11–3.13 and GNU Make. The reference development versions
are recorded in `.python-version` and `.nvmrc`; Node is not needed until the Web
stage.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shaw485/search-engine-eva-agent.git
cd search-engine-eva-agent
make setup
make check
```

`make check` runs formatting/lint checks, repository policy checks, all tests,
and the deterministic local smoke path. Individual commands are also available:

```bash
make test
make data-sample
make smoke
make eval-baseline
make compare-runs
BASELINE_RUN_ID=... CANDIDATE_RUN_ID=... make agent-smoke
make agent-eval
make query-set-smoke
make bad-cases-smoke
make catalog-index
EVAL_RANKER=title-bm25 make eval-baseline
QUERY="iphone 15 pro case" make smoke
```

`make eval-baseline` runs all three deterministic comparators on the fixed
20-Query smoke profile. The smoke results validate the Harness; they are not a
formal quality decision. `make compare-runs` then compares the latest random
baseline with title BM25 and stores immutable JSON plus a Markdown diagnostic
report under ignored `runs/comparisons/`.

`make agent-smoke` accepts two already trusted smoke Run IDs, executes the
deterministic observation-driven Runtime, and stores a Trace under ignored
`runs/agent-traces/`. See [docs/AGENT_RUNTIME.md](docs/AGENT_RUNTIME.md) for
the optional LLM retrieval Planner, safe Key injection, Replay, logging filters
and current capability limits.

`make agent-eval` runs all 12 fixed Agent-behavior tasks and writes deterministic
evidence plus a separate execution receipt under ignored `runs/agent-evals/`.
`make query-set-smoke` creates an immutable exploratory Query set under
`runs/query-sets/`. Neither command approves a proposal, changes an active
strategy, deploys code or unlocks larger evaluation profiles.

`make bad-cases-smoke` preflights and searches all 59 cases, then stores hashed
behavioral evidence under `runs/bad-case-diagnostics/`. Its categories are
diagnostic candidates, not relevance judgments or formal benchmark results. A
successful summary also cites the private immutable supervisor receipt that
binds the execution to the hard worker policy.

The Stage 2 CLI trusts the local operator and only loads artifacts directly from
the project's ignored `runs/` store. Run and comparison IDs are content hashes:
they detect accidental or conflicting content changes, but they are not digital
signatures and do not prove that a ranking was produced by the declared code.
The current Stage 3 scaffold therefore accepts validated Run IDs from a
controlled registry, never arbitrary filesystem paths.

The Stage 1 data path is separate so CI never downloads the 1.16 GB source:

```bash
make data-download
make data-esci-validate
make data-esci-build
```

After the pinned source is present, `make catalog-index` builds the ignored
full-catalog artifact at `data/index/catalog-baseline-v1.sqlite3`. The command
requires a clean Git revision so the index identity can record the exact code.
`make catalog-index-v2` is the separately streamed full-field build used by the
approved active canary lane. Its 1,814,924-product artifact is not built during
normal tests or committed to Git; use the resource and activation gates in
`docs/CATALOG_V2_SERVING.md` before production publication.

Start the Stage 0 API with:

```bash
make api
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
curl --request POST 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/smoke' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"query":"wireless mouse","top_k":3,"backend":"local"}'

curl --request POST 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/catalog/search' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"query":"wireless mouse","top_k":10}'

curl --request POST 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/agent/strategy/propose' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"profile":"smoke"}'

curl 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/agent/strategy/catalog'

curl --request POST 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/agent/retrieval/analyze' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"profile":"smoke"}'

curl --request POST 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/agent/eval/run' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"suite":"stage5-retrieval-v1"}'

curl --request POST 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/agent/query-constructor/build' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"source":"smoke"}'

curl --request POST 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/agent/bad-cases/run' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"source":"smoke"}'
```

`/agent/retrieval/analyze` creates a bounded Runtime task, executes two
allowlisted retrieval tools, validates the terminal Trace through offline
Replay, and returns the baseline/candidate stage metrics, diagnoses, all three
candidate outcomes, 12 gate checks, representative Top-5 evidence and a
privacy-safe action timeline. It is an analysis route, not an activation route.
In the Nginx reference configuration it shares the authenticated
Agent-workbench boundary and has request access logging disabled because its
response contains Query and product evidence.

The Agent Eval and Query-constructor routes are also exact, authenticated Nginx
locations. Their browser responses contain only aggregate counts and evidence
IDs; detailed traces and raw Query cases remain private server-side artifacts.
The Bad Case route is separately owner-only and may return at most 12 transient,
hash-checked display samples; its persisted diagnostic evidence remains
hash-only and the production response is marked `Cache-Control: no-store`.

## What the Stage 0 vector result means

Stage 0 uses `deterministic-hash-v1`, a 64-dimensional hashing vector with no
downloaded model. It verifies vector dimensions, indexing, cosine ranking,
determinism, and backend interchangeability. It is **not a semantic embedding**
and its rankings are not evidence that vector search improves relevance. A
versioned semantic model is introduced in Stage 6 and evaluated only after the
Stage 2 metrics are trusted.

The local and OpenSearch adapters share a method and normalized-result contract,
not identical scores or rankings. Their analyzers and BM25 field weights differ.
Later experiment manifests must record the backend and configuration; quality is
compared with relevance metrics rather than raw cross-backend scores.

                  normalized hits + smoke JSON
```

The embedding provider is intentionally separate from storage. Search and
future evaluation code do not depend on an LLM or an external model API.

The current stage-aware experiment is a separate query-scoped path:

```text
RetrievalOptimizationTask
  -> Runtime / observation-driven Planner
  -> diagnose baseline tool
  -> candidate experiment tool: uniform -> conservative -> aggressive probe
  -> Search Evaluation Harness + 12 gates
  -> immutable Trace + offline Replay
  -> Owner-reviewable evidence (no activation)
```

## Optional OpenSearch smoke

OpenSearch is not required for the accepted local Stage 0 path. To run the
optional integration after installing Docker Desktop:

```bash
make opensearch-up
make smoke-opensearch
make opensearch-down
```

Allocate at least 4 GB to Docker Desktop. The image is pinned by version and
multi-architecture digest, so Apple Silicon runs the native ARM64 image without
forcing `linux/amd64`.

This Compose profile disables the OpenSearch security plugin and binds port
9200 only to `127.0.0.1`. It is for a private local smoke test only and must
never be exposed or reused as a shared/production configuration. Index reset is
protected by localhost, project-prefix, explicit opt-in, and cluster identity
checks. Do not run multiple OpenSearch smoke commands concurrently; Stage 0
rebuilds a fixed disposable index.

## Dataset

The official Amazon ESCI repository is pinned under `data/esci-data` as a Git
submodule. Its two Parquet files are stored upstream with Git LFS; the products
file alone is about 1.03 GB. The download command retrieves the objects at the
pinned commit directly into ignored `data/raw/esci/` and verifies their exact
sizes and SHA-256 hashes. Git LFS is not required locally.

The full dataset is not downloaded by `make setup` or CI:

```bash
make data-download
make data-esci-build
```

Raw files stay under `data/raw/esci/`; generated Parquet stays under
`data/processed/esci-stage1-v1/`. Neither directory is committed.
The repository does commit the 175 KB real ESCI smoke profile at
`data/samples/esci-stage1-smoke.parquet` so the schema and labels can be
inspected without the full download.

- Dataset source: [amazon-science/esci-data](https://github.com/amazon-science/esci-data)
- Pinned upstream commit: `7916cdf6ab75a462e77f20ab40428a10923998d5`
- Upstream license: [Apache-2.0](https://github.com/amazon-science/esci-data/blob/main/LICENSE)

ESCI labels cover judged candidates for each query, not every Amazon product.
The primary benchmark therefore reranks fully judged candidate sets. A separate
closed-corpus track is used for retrieval metrics so incomplete judgments are
not presented as full-catalog recall.

## Next step

Commit and review the LLM Planner slice, then run its first real-provider smoke
with an explicit model and server-only Key while recording Token/latency and
comparing its decisions with the deterministic control. In parallel, complete
the Human Diagnostic Oracle judgments before treating behavioral candidates as
confirmed Bad Cases. The current single-stage executor already covers all 59
source-bounded cases but cannot establish relevance quality. The Owner still
needs to complete the Stage 1
data-boundary and Stage 2 metric learning evidence before the 500-Query dev
profile is explicitly unlocked; frozen test remains unavailable to tuning.
